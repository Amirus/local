Browser Support
===============

pfraze 2013

The following features are required for browser support:

 - <a target="_top" href="http://caniuse.com/#search=CSP">Content Security Policy</a>: IE, Opera
 - CustomEvent: IE (there's probably a fix, but I haven't gotten to it yet)

 *This list may not be complete; more testing required.*
