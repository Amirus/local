The Environment
===============

pfraze 2013

The client environment sets the tone for its applications. It decides what services may be available, and to whom; it lays out the page; it instantiates and manages servers; and it implements any custom UI behaviors. It's responsible for most of the security and privacy choices (it has control of the client session) and may exert as little or as much opinion as it likes.
