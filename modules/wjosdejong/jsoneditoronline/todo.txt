JSON EDITOR ONLINE TODO
http://jsoneditoronline.org


________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 1: Basic functionality

TODO
make the css namings more efficient/shorter

Get things working in IE7? maybe only a sizing problem (besides no JSON support)

for highlighting and expanding: send a timestamp, and when very large,
  split via a timeout in different parts so, the browser stays responsive.
  
________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 2: Functionality

make the editor more keyboard friendly. Shortcut keys, access to the type dropdown menu

alt+arrow keys to navigate through the fields and values

copy a structure via Ctrl+ drag and drop?

undo/redo

load files from url or by upload

store the contents in the browser. also store all revisions (used with undo/redo)

add documentation/information about JSON in general

write documentation about the sourcecode

warning when an object has mutliple fields with the same name

create options:
  - collapsed: true/false
  - editableFields: true/false

when dragging higher than the top, or lower than the bottom, scroll the 
  whole editor.

VERSION 3: Performance

performance improvements: lazy loading of the HTML elements
method getValue() should retrieve the data from its in memory JSON, and not 
  by reading the from the fields on screen. Fields on screen must directly
  update their value in memory when changed. 
  Also, the in memory JSON should correspond one to one to the real JSON data...

automatically update left or right panel contents on change?


________________________________________________________________________

VERSION 4: Validator

Implement a JSON Schema validator
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json#Schema
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03

the editor on the right will get an extra button on the right: for specifying 
validation  parameters. On the left, we will get two text editors on top of each
other: one with the JSON data, the other with the JSON schema.
By default, the validator is not visible. There will be an option in the main
menu to toggle validator.

Also: create buttons to generate JSON from a schema.
